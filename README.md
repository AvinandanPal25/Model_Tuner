# ML Model__Tuner 
#### ---- by Avinandan Pal

This Application is useful to find out the BEST Score of a Selected Model on a Particular Dataset. This can be achieved by tunning certain parameters specific to the Model. You can also copy your desired combination of parameters and paste them in your code.

Pre-loaded datasets are from kaggle, and those are----
1. [Bank Churn Predictor](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers)
2. [Social Network Adds](https://www.kaggle.com/muralidhar123/social-network-adds-prediction)
3. [House Price Predictor](https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)

Models used in this Project are----
1. Gradient Boosting Algorithm
2. Xgboost Algorithm
